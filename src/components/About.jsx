          Hi, Iâ€™m Terrence Taylor. A enthusiastic frontend developer based in
          Melbourne, Australia. I am passionate in building responsive and
          engaging digital experiences. Outside of coding I love fostering
          animals, 3d modelling or listening to music.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a frontend developer I have an awesome range within my skill set,
          this includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Tailwind. On top of
          this foundation I have worked with many different tools and
          technologies including Figma, Github, Firebase, Cloudflare Pages and
          Functions, and Vite.
