                A 17+ page (not including dynamic pages) project encompassing
                many aspects of the rescue. Creating this involved serving
                dynamic content in the form of the animal adoption profiles
                which is taken from a third party API that the organisation uses
                for their profiles. To obscure their API keys a backend API
                handler had to be created which was implemented using
                Cloudflareâ€™s edge functions
