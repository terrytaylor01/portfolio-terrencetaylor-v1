                This site acts a connection point between the animal rescue
                organisation and the community in which it operates.

                This site involves serving dynamic content in the form of the
                animal adoption profiles which is taken from a third party API
                that the organisation uses for their profiles. To obscure their
                API keys a backend API handler had to be created which was
                implemented using Cloudflareâ€™s edge functions
