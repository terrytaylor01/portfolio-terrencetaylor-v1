                This project is a clone of the Reddit homepage, it features a
                list of posts in rows, with the ability to expand text posts to
                see the body text, and image posts to preview the image.

                This project was a great opportunity for me to showcase my
                skills in front-end development, particularly with React,
                TailwindCSS as well as interfacing with a SQL database through
                Supabase. The challenge of replicating the functionality of
                Reddit's homepage allowed me to demonstrate my proficiency in
                creating intuitive and responsive user interfaces emulating a
                large commercial product. The implementation of user
                authentication, post filtering, and voting features required a
                deep understanding of how to integrate with back-end services, a
                crucial aspect for any front-end developer.

                Bridging the gap between the rescue organization and the
                community, this site facilitates pet adoption profiles,
                volunteer sign-ups, and educational resources.

                A 19+ page project encompassing many aspects of the rescue.
                Creating this involved serving dynamic content in the form of
                the animal adoption profiles which is taken from a third party
                RESTful API that the organisation uses for their profiles. To
                obscure their API keys a backend API handler had to be created
                which was implemented using Cloudflareâ€™s edge functions
