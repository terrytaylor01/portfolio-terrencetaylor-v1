## Reflection
Creating this portfolio was an exciting journey that allowed me to showcase my skills and creativity as a front-end developer. 

One of the key features of this portfolio is its responsiveness. The layout is unique and ensures that the site looks great on devices of all sizes. Implementing this feature was rewarding, as it required a solid understanding of modern web design principles especially working with the Tailwind CSS framework.

Another interesting feature is the dark mode, which was implemented using React Context variables. This not only enhances the user experience by providing a comfortable viewing option in low-light environments, but also demonstrates my ability to use advanced React features in a practical setting.

This portfolio serves as a testament to my dedication to creating intuitive and aesthetically pleasing digital experiences. I look forward to bringing these skills and passion to future roles in front-end development.
